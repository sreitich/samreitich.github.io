Howdy! I'm Sam, though you'll sometimes see me online as "Samathan."



I'm a game developer specializing in **gameplay programming** and **tools.** Most of my work is in Unreal Engine, which I've been using for the last eight years.



I use this site to share some cool features I think people may find useful or interesting. My personal projects are all open-source; you can check out [my GitHub page](https://github.com/sreitich) if you ever want to see how I implement the features on this page into my actual games, or to see how I implement other features and systems that are too big to fit into blog posts.



Feel free to reach out to me on the Unreal Engine Discord server for help! You can usually find me in the #cpp and #gameplay-ability-system channels, which are my areas of expertise in the engine.



For any other inquiries, you can reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samreitich/).
